TypeScript --> JS --> Interpreted (Process of Transpilation)

Points to remember about TypeScript:
It is similar to Java but here are some differences : 
1) Superclass constructor is not called by default in TypeScript
2) There is no concept of constructor overloading in TypeScript (no concept of overloading/overriding)
3) Interfaces in Ts is very much different from interfaces in java : 
    (1) We can't iniliatize values of variables in interface in Ts
    (2) We can create an object of interface in ts
