# Stream APIs

1) Sequential - By default stream api is Sequential
2) Parallel

3 phases in stream API : 

1) Initialization --> Collection object -> stream
2) Processing --> stream -> stream (Some operation is performed)
3) Termination --> stream -> Collection object

For Processing we have many methods like map(), filter, etc.

Note :  Package used is java.util.stream.Stream which contains stream processing methods.

# Comparison between map, filter and reduce

---------  -----   ------
map         n       n
filter      n       <=n
reduce      n       1
