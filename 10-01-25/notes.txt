Access Modifiers : 

1) Class can be only public and default. Can't be private or protected. Inner classes can be private/protected(Nested classes).

2) Default scope means class is accessible in same package.

3) Public Class is accessible by everyone including inter package classes.

4) Private is not accessible by anyone except within the class

5) Protected access --> All package classes can access it but only inherited subclasses in other packages can access it.

6) Default scope --> All classes in a package can access it.

7) Access modifiers in ascending order:

private, default, protected, public.

8) Protected scope is directly accessed by subclasses.


Creating a package : 

1) IF 

   p1(A, B, C)
   |
   |
   p2(D, E, F)

p2 is a sub package of p1.

To access all classes we need to import p1.*, import p1.p2.*

2) Java code (A.java)

package abc.xyz.com

command : javac -d . A.java (Compile with this to create package)

java abc.xyz.com.A (Running)
