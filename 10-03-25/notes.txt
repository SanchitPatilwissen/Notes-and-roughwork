Module
------

command : ng new project_name --no-standalone

imports
exports
bootstrap
declarations : Components, Pipes, directives
providers : Services

Note : In angular Module is a collection of Components, pipes, directives and Services.

Routing
--------

we have app-routing.module.ts to mention routing path and corresponding components for those paths.

we have to mention <router-outlet></router-outlet> where we want to apply routing.

we use routerLink instead of href while using routing.
