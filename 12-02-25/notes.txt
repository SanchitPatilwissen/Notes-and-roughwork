Junit :

JUnit 4
JUnit 5 - Jupiter
    --> Lambda expression
    --> Multiple new patterns
    --> Microservices
    --> Many new features

Test Driven Development --> First test cases are written then implementation.
Test Runner --> Who is running all the test cases.

# Difference between assumption and assertion : 

--> assertion --> Used to test the functionality
--> assumption --> Used to decide whether to assert or not.

Note : For every test method there is an object created of test Class. Adding @TestInstance(Lifecycle.PER_CLASS) above class will help in creating only 1 object for all test cases which will improve a lot of memory by creating less object and thus improving the Performance.
