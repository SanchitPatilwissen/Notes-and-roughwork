Sharing data among multiple components occurs through props and state.But props are immutable and state cannot be shared. Therefore, there is a need for a technique to share data among multiple components in an editable way.

We make use of Redux for this purpose. It can also be done using React Context API. (useContext)

Redux is a state management Framework. It is not specific to React. It can be used with any other framework as well.
