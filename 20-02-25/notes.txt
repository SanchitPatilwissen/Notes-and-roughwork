Spring Data JPA
----------------
1) JDBC
2) ORM
3) Hibernate, iBatis, TopLink, etc.
4) JPA 

ORM - Object Relational Mapping

class Employee{
    String name, int id, int age, double salary, String designation;
}

This object is mapped into a relation using an ORM. ORM is a concept not a technology just like OOP.

Hibernate is a framework(technology) which implements ORM.

If we change our framework then we will have to change the entire application. This is the reason why we follow JPA standard.
JPA contains some standard interfaces which are implemented by hibernate, iBatis, TopLink, etc.

There is an inbuilt dependency on h2 database. We can use it if we donot have any db on system.
