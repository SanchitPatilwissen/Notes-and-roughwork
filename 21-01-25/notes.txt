java packages :

1) java.lang --> By default all packages are imported

2) java.util --> 
    Scanner, Random, Date, Stack, Calendar, GregorianCalendar, BitSet, ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, HashMap, TreeMap, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet

    (1) Scanner : To take input from console, file or any input stream.
    (2) Random : To generate random numbers
    (3) Date : To create date object comprising of date along with time. Time elapsed from 01/01/1970 00:00:00 calculated in milli secs.
    (4) 

Collection framework classes :
Those classes which can hold more than one classes.

Collection interface extended By
1) Set
    HashSet --> Uses Hashing algo. Searching is fast but order is not maintained.
    TreeSet --> Uses binary tree to store data. Searching is slow but order is maintained. 
    LinkedSet --> Elements stored in the order you entered. 
2) Queue 
    Deque --> Double ended queue. Both sides will be open.Implemented using ArrayDeque. Can be used in Lifts.
    PriorityQueue --> Elements are popped out based on priority.
3) List 
    By default FIFO order.
    Vector --> Older class. Stack extends Vector class. (All methods are synchronised)
    ArrayList --> Newer class. (No methods are synchronised). Used where less insertion/deletion but more accessing. Real time use in Schools/Colleges.
    LinkedList --> Used where more insertion/deletion but less accessing. Real time use in IRCTC website where insertion/deletion of tickets happens more.
Map
    HashTable --> synchronised methods.
    HashMap --> no synchronised methods. Allows null key, value.
    TreeMap --> Sorted order is maintained.
    LinkedHashedMap --> Actual order is stored.
