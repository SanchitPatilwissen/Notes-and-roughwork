# Microservices --> Architecture

Traditional Architecture --> Monolithic applications

Monolithic                                     Microservices
----------                                     -------------
Single server                                  Multiple servers
Single DB                                      Multiple DBs
All modules in single server                   Isolated on its own server and DB

Steps for Microservices : 
1) Create services
2) Register services in Eureka server
3) Discover the services from Eureka server
4) Load Balancing
5) Fail Over
6) API Gateway
