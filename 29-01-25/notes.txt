JDBC : JAVA DATABASE CONNECTIVITY (SunMicrosystem --> Company which created java) --> Used in any OS

ODBC : OPEN DATABASE CONNECTIVITY (Microsoft) --> Only used in windows OS

Driver : Program which knows how that hardware works.

1) Steps for connecting to DB : 
    1) Load/Register Driver.
        1) JDBC - ODBC bridge
        2) Part-Java Part-Native
        3) Pure Native
        4) Pure Java (THIN drivers cause light weight)
        Class.forName("driver-class") --> For loading the driver.

    2) Connect to DATABASE
        DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);
    3) Create a statement object.
        Statement stmt = con.CreateStatement(); --> Just like keeping paper and ink in printer
    4) Execute queries.
        stmt.executeUpdate("insert/update/delete ...etc");
        ResultSet = stmt.executeQuery("select * from ...");

2) Types of statements : 
    1) Simple Statement
