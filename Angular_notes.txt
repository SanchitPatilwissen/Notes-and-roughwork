Single page app divided into components.

1) Installing Angular : 
	Firstly you require nodejs installed on your system
	Then run command : 
	npm install -g @angular/cli
2) Creating a new app : Generates base code

# Data Binding
1) Interpolation 
	Adding ts variables in html template using {{}}.
2) Event Binding
	using () to denote an event on a tag and mentioning the ts function.

	We use this to store the form values in variables 
	[(ngModel)]="variable_name" --> Used in input-tag
